///
/// * `<source>/…/SKILL.md` — manifest create/modify/remove at **any depth
///   under the source** (used by the skill manifest tracking pipeline),
///   except under `.skill-meta` (see below). The store loads both the
///   flat (`<source>/<skill>/SKILL.md`) and the categorized
///   (`<source>/<category>/<skill>/SKILL.md`) layout first-class, so
///   manifest events from either layout must be surfaced; downstream
///   `DriftEvent::classify` routes deep manifests to
///   `InsideSourceOutsideSkill`, so consuming them is safe. A `SKILL.md`
///   directly at the source root is not a manifest in any loaded layout
///   and stays unclassified.
/// * `<source>/<skill>` — immediate skill-directory create/remove, including
///   inotify move events: `RenameMode::To` (move-in / rename target) restats
///   the path no-follow like `Create` (a symlink to a directory is not a
///   skill directory); `RenameMode::From` (move-out / rename source)
///   is emitted only for paths whose directory-ness the watcher has
///   retained — from the startup seed of the source root, from a restat of
///   an earlier event, or from the correlated new side of a paired rename —
///   because the moved-away path itself can no longer be restated, and a
///   skill-shaped regular *file* moved out must never be reported as a
///   skill-directory deletion.
///
/// Arbitrary non-manifest files inside a skill (`scripts/run.sh`,
/// `notes.txt`, `.skill-meta/manifest.json`) are **not** surfaced, and
/// neither is anything under a `.skill-meta` directory: version snapshots
/// and other store-internal state live there (e.g.
/// `<source>/<skill>/.skill-meta/versions/<v>.snapshot/SKILL.md`), and
/// observing the store's own writes would only emit drift noise about
/// its internals. The W1 drift runtime in `skillfs-fuse` therefore
/// observes manifest- and skill-directory-level drift, mirroring this
/// helper's scope.
/// No-follow directory test for the arms whose path still exists (the
/// Create and move-in `To` arms): the path is restattable, but without
/// following links — the same no-follow contract as the startup seed, the
/// flush refresh, and the paired-rename correlation. `Path::is_dir`
/// follows the link target, so a symlink pointing at a real directory was
/// classified as a DirCreated for a non-skill object, an unbalanced
/// phantom in the drift/audit trail.
