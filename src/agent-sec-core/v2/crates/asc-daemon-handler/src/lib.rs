//! Inbound daemon protocol adapters for application use cases.
//!
//! This crate translates bounded transport requests into versioned daemon
//! protocol calls, applies server-owned authorization, routes accepted calls to
//! application ports, and projects application or transport failures back into
//! protocol responses. Process bootstrap and transport execution remain in
//! `asc-daemon` and `asc-daemon-service`, respectively.
