# AW

[中文版](README_zh.md)

AW provides unified configuration, versioned capability contracts and embeddable execution libraries. `aw-config` validates configuration; `aw-provider` checks Provider messages and admission offline; `aw-host` prepares and invokes local Providers through bounded command transport. `aw-contracts` checks record relationships, while `aw-core` executes pinned plans through caller-provided Hosts and journals execution facts. AW has no service process; native Agent control and final tool dispatch remain with the embedding application.

The interfaces are experimental. Contract tests use synthetic records; command
transport tests use local child processes. Neither certifies Agent integration.

## Validate a configuration

From the repository root, use the offline example to check a configuration:

```bash
cd src/aw
cargo run --locked -p aw-config --example validate -- crates/aw-config/examples/aw.minimal.yaml
```

A successful result confirms configuration syntax and static references. It does
not start an Agent or enable a policy. See the [configuration guide](../../docs/developer-guide/en/aw/configuration.md)
for fields and examples, and [Contributing to AW](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development
setup, tests and CI.

## Local Provider Host

`aw-host` runs real `describe`, `validate_config` and `invoke` exchanges on Linux.
It retains configuration and process context, enforces shared event deadlines,
and returns candidate effects separately from execution failures. The caller
supplies trusted Adapter capabilities and owns scheduling and effect adoption.

Try the [local Host example](docs/design/provider-host.md#local-example) with the
sample policy. It uses synthetic tool events and does not launch an Agent,
install Hooks or persist audit records.

## sec-core Provider

The Linux `aw-provider-sec-core` binary maps configured tool inputs to the public
`agent-sec-cli scan-code` command. It supplies candidate before-tool observe/block
and after-tool observation through the AW Provider protocol. It requires an
existing sec-core CLI and daemon; no AW code is installed inside sec-core.
See the [sec-core Provider guide](../../docs/user-guide/en/user-entrypoint/aw-sec-core.md)
for source builds, configuration and a local Host example.

## Core embedding

`aw-core` provides `Core::prepare` and `Core::execute`, trusted Host/Clock/Journal
ports, and a durable Linux `FileJournal`. Preparation checks the complete plan
before any provider call. Execution records each call before dispatch and returns
terminal results only after the journal acknowledges them. Failed or interrupted
events remain reserved; there is no automatic retry or recovery.

See [Core execution and storage](docs/design/core-execution.md) for ownership,
cancellation, failure and embedding contracts. Core tests use synthetic Hosts;
native Agent integration and effect adoption require separate runtime validation.

## Command execution

`aw-exec` runs individual commands on Linux with an absolute deadline, byte limits,
cancellation and owned process-group cleanup. Native stdout, stderr and exit status
remain for the caller to interpret. `aw-host` adds the Provider JSON protocol;
native command callers keep using the raw byte interface. Daemon and Agent
adapters remain separate work.
See [bounded command execution](docs/design/bounded-execution.md) for its API,
ownership and validation boundaries.

The Registry includes 21 schema resources. The eight v1 resources in `crates/aw-contracts/schemas/` are reference copies and are not registered. Callers must use matching schema IDs and digests; no automatic version conversion is provided.

Parse incoming wire records with `canonical::parse` before schema validation. Shape checks alone do not validate record relationships or grant authorization. Follow the public API documentation for plan-level checks; callers remain responsible for authenticating evidence and enforcing actions.

User configuration uses the separate `aw-config` crate and its bundled
`aw/v1alpha1` schema. It accepts one `AWConfiguration` object with
`apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata` and `spec`; Provider instances are named objects
under `spec.providers`. The schema recognizes QwenPaw, Qoder CLI, OpenClaw,
Hermes and all 16 event names, without claiming adapters are implemented.
Configuration has no runtime `status`. `aw-provider` validates externally supplied
operation/private-config responses and admits tool steps against caller-trusted
Adapter capabilities. It does not execute discovery or establish native adoption.
`aw-host` executes those exchanges; native binding installation remains subsequent work.
See the [configuration design](docs/design/configuration.md) for the separation
from the existing wire contracts.
