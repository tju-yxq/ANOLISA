- **anolisa**: Updated to v0.3.15, adds OpenCode adapter enable/status/disable with custom config directories, conflict protection, and interrupted-operation retries, plus local cosh-ng diagnostic bundles with health findings in Markdown/JSON reports and no automatic upload; supports Yum 3/DNF 4 with exact versions, direct RPM metadata validation honoring system proxy/private CA settings, and local package queries or Raw installation without remote repositories; checks combined RPM install conflicts in root upgrade previews, distinguishes failed probes from missing components, verifies declared subpackage payloads, and redacts repository credentials, paths, and query strings while retaining origins, administrators get reliable lifecycle checks and actionable diagnostics (#3346, #3317, #3318, #3353, #3294, #3230, #3240, #3280, #3285, #3292, #3417, #3431)
- **agent-memory**: Updated to v0.2.8, falls back to private per-user runtime or temporary session directories with ownership, permission, and symlink checks, corrects BM25 ranking for search, hybrid retrieval, and automatic recall, and renames OpenClaw tools to `anolisa_memory_search` and `anolisa_memory_get`; declares all four tools in the `coding` profile, rejects the unsupported `expert` profile with guidance, strengthens `sessionId`/`sessionDir` validation and old-client shutdown ordering, and restores source-archive configuration, examples, and adapter assets, users can run without privileged session-directory setup and retain stable access to both memory systems (#3266, #3296, #3347, #3238, #3213, #3231)

- **ws-ckpt and cosh-ng version pairing**: Managed Task guarded rollback requires ws-ckpt daemon 0.5.0 or newer. The ws-ckpt OpenClaw adapter requires OpenClaw 2026.2.13 or newer. Upgrade cosh-ng and ws-ckpt together and check the OpenClaw version before enabling the adapter (#2911, #3221).
- **Tokenless installation requirements**: npm requires Node.js 16.7 or newer. Linux source installation provides only the Tokenless CLI; RTK and framework adapters are supplied by npm. Prefer npm for full Agent integration and check resource ownership before switching installation methods (#2322).
- **cosh-ng login shell behavior**: Enhanced Bash uses native login shell identity by default on Bash 4+ and loads `/etc/profile` and `~/.bash_profile`. Set `shell.login_identity = false` to retain the previous behavior (#3358).

### Highlights

- **cosh-ng**: Updated to v0.24.1, routes natural-language and path-like input to the Agent in Enhanced Assisted Zsh while preserving ordinary Shell behavior and the user's terminal customizations, users get a more natural Zsh experience without rebuilding their existing setup (#3004, #3156)
- **agent-sec-core**: Updated to v0.12.0, applies configured policy checks consistently to legacy cosh and cosh-ng Skill calls while reducing false positives, users get consistent Skill enforcement and fewer incorrect security findings across both shells (#2871, #2928)

- **agent-sec-core**: Updated to v0.12.0, applies the same Skill policies across legacy cosh and cosh-ng, reduces scanner false positives, reports every integrity outcome through `skill-ledger` and `check`, and speeds up container health checks, users get consistent enforcement, clearer verification results, and faster readiness checks (#2707, #2871, #2879, #2928)
- **agentsight**: Updated to v0.12.1, adds collection without eBPF, native DashScope and Kubernetes deployment support, Agent resource monitoring, and cosh-ng traffic capture while improving attribution accuracy, tool-result retention, enforcement synchronization, Token accounting, stream completion, duplicate suppression, startup recovery, and automatic capture recovery, operators can trust timelines and usage totals while keeping monitoring and protection running through long-lived workloads and transient failures (#2916, #2954, #2976, #2979, #3005, #3011, #3016, #3081, #3087, #3135, #3147, #3191)

### Compatibility

- **Tokenless Protocol v2**: `tokenless compress` now accepts only `before_model`, `pre_tool`, `post_tool`, and `retrieve` lifecycle requests; Protocol v1 and `tokenless mcp serve` have been removed. Upgrade Tokenless Core, CLI, SDKs, and adapters together and declare recovery capability explicitly to avoid protocol or retrieval mismatches (#2978, #3068).
- **Tokenless Rust APIs**: Replace `TokenlessRuntime::compress` with the Runtime lifecycle methods. Direct response-compression callers must migrate from the removed `tokenless-pipeline` crate and `tokenless_schema::ResponseCompressor` to the Runtime or `tokenless-compressors` APIs (#2974, #2978).
- **Tokenless Python and AgentScope APIs**: Replace the removed `ModelRequest`, `ToolCall`, `ToolResult`, and `ToolResponseCompressor` types with typed `before_model`, `pre_tool`, `post_tool`, and `retrieve` lifecycle requests. AgentScope integrations must add `ToolContract` metadata for custom tools and expose one static retrieval tool (#2986, #3029).
- **Tokenless retrieval configuration**: Custom `retrieve_tool_name` values must satisfy the tool-name rules. Lifecycle schema compression now requires an authorized static retrieval tool and an available Stash; without both, hooks preserve the original schemas. Recovering omitted content also requires a reachable CLI or static tool and a host that can replace the current tool result, including Claude Code 2.1.121 or newer. Existing `<<tokenless:HASH>>` markers remain readable (#2978, #2995, #3029, #3052, #3068).
- **Tokenless adapter configuration**: OpenClaw now uses `post_tool_enabled` for PostTool optimization; its former response, TOON, skip-tool, and shell-tool policy settings have been removed and no longer control compression. Remove those obsolete settings and configure `post_tool_enabled` when upgrading. DeepSeek Harness users must also remove adapter-specific thresholds and tool lists and use the shared compression policy. OpenClaw remains limited to lossless transcript updates without same-turn replacement or retrieval (#3009, #3036).
- **Tokenless statistics fields**: Dashboards and integrations must replace `seam` and `compressor_chain` with `content_origin`, `applied_operations`, and `recoverability`. The legacy SQLite columns remain for compatibility, but new records no longer populate them, so queries that keep using the old fields can return empty or incorrect reports after upgrading (#2978).
- **AgentSight timestamps**: Kernel event timestamps are now calibrated to host wall-clock time instead of container uptime. If NTP or an administrator steps the host wall clock while kernel events are queued, affected historical wall-clock timestamps cannot be reconstructed; persisted records are unaffected. Mark each wall-clock adjustment when analyzing timelines across it (#3128).
- **agent-sec-core Python dependency**: Python deployments and source builds now require `cryptography` 50.0.1 or newer. Refresh the environment from the exported requirements before upgrading custom installations (#3015).
- **agent-memory source builds**: Building the OpenClaw adapter from source now requires Node.js 20 or newer and npm. The unified user-mode build provisions them automatically; system-mode builds report missing tools during preflight (#3187).
- **anolisa RPM previews**: On DNF 4 systems, RPM install `--dry-run` requires `sudo` and may refresh repository metadata while checking solver conflicts. The check now runs before recovery journals are created (#3158).
- **anolisa editable configs and state format**: Allowing content edits to raw-installed `type = "config"` files does not change update or uninstall semantics, so back up customized configs before either operation. The new `kind = "config"` state records are unreadable by older CLI versions; before downgrading, also back up state and convert affected owned-file entries to `kind = "file"` to restore content-digest validation (#3142).
