# AgentSight Dashboard Guide

[中文版](../../../zh/agent-observability/agentsight/dashboard.md)

The Dashboard is a web UI embedded in the `agentsight` binary. It reads the same SQLite databases
the tracer writes, so it needs no extra service. Default address: `http://127.0.0.1:7396`.

## Start it

```bash
# local only (default)
sudo agentsight serve

# reachable from other hosts
sudo agentsight serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7396
```

The packaged `agentsight.service` already runs `serve --host 0.0.0.0` alongside the tracer, so on a
normal install you only need to open the URL. Binding to `0.0.0.0` exposes the port on every
interface — restrict it in your firewall or cloud security group first.

## Authentication

Token authentication is on by default.

| Access path | What is required |
|---|---|
| `http://127.0.0.1:7396` from the same host | Nothing; loopback requests skip authentication |
| `http://<host>:7396` from elsewhere | The Dashboard token, as `?token=<TOKEN>` in the URL, as `Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>`, or typed into the login form |

![Dashboard login screen](../../../../images/agentsight/en/dashboard-login.png)

The token is generated on the first `serve` start (64 hex characters) and stored next to the
databases in `/var/log/sysak/.agentsight/.dashboard_token`. It is reused across restarts. Read it
with:

```bash
sudo agentsight dashboard --no-open
```

A successful login exchanges the token for an httpOnly session cookie, so you do not have to keep
the token in the URL.

An invalid-token message means the server rejected the token; check it with the command above.
A connection-error message can also mean the server or a reverse proxy returned an HTTP error.
Check that AgentSight is running and reachable, then retry the login.

To turn authentication off — only sensible on a trusted internal network:

```json
{ "server": { "auth": { "enabled": false } } }
```

```bash
sudo systemctl reload agentsight.service
```

> `sudo agentsight dashboard --no-open` prints the complete token; the login screen links to that
> command.

## Navigation and page availability

The navigation bar only shows pages the host can actually serve. AgentSight probes for companion
components on every page load and reports the result through `GET /api/auth/status`:

| Page | Appears when |
|---|---|
| Agent Dashboard, Agent Observability, Sessions, Reuse Labels, Optimization, Skill Metrics, Trajectory Viewer, Settings | Always |
| Token Savings | `tokenless` is installed, or its statistics database exists |
| Security Observability, System Audit | `agent-sec-core` is installed (daemon or CLI) |
| Risk Enforcement | `agentsight-enforcer` is installed or its socket exists |

So a Dashboard that shows fewer entries than this guide is not broken — the matching component is
simply not installed.

A fresh visit to `http://<host>:7396/` lands on the Agent Dashboard (`#/health`). The bare root
renders no page of its own: it redirects to the first entry in navigation order whose capability is
advertised, so a host that does not report `agent_health` lands on Agent Observability instead.
Agent Observability is reachable at `#/observability`, whether or not it is the landing page.

Most pages share the same header: a start/end time range with `Last 1h / 6h / 24h / 7d` shortcuts,
an Agent filter, and a **Query** button. Pages that show cost or savings figures wait for you to
press **Query**; the observability pages load the last 24 hours immediately.

## Agent Dashboard

Live Agent health plus the interruption inbox: every unresolved event with its type, severity,
session, and conversation. **Resolve** closes an event, **Details** opens the captured evidence.
The latency panel switches between the last 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days.

![Agent Dashboard with the interruption inbox](../../../../images/agentsight/en/dashboard-agent-health.png)

"No agents discovered" only means no Agent process is running right now; historical sessions stay
visible on the other pages.

## Agent Observability

The main analysis page: session count, input/output Tokens, interruption count by severity, Token
time series (total and per model), and the session table.

![Agent Observability page](../../../../images/agentsight/en/dashboard-observability.png)

Click a session row to expand the conversations it contains. Each conversation row shows the user
query, its Tokens, an interruption badge, and a quality **Eval** action:

![Expanded session showing its conversations](../../../../images/agentsight/en/dashboard-session-expanded.png)

The expanded Session also shows CPU and RSS memory curves for its associated Agent processes. Blue
background bands mark captured LLM calls, violet bands mark matched Tool Call intervals, and orange
bands mark idle time between observed activities. Values from multiple associated PIDs are summed.
The chart is process-level context, so a shared Agent process serving concurrent Sessions cannot be
split into exact per-Session resource consumption.

The `SAVED TOKENS` column is filled in when Tokenless is active for that session.

## Sessions

A session browser rather than a metrics page: filter by capture source (`eBPF capture` versus
`Log collection`), filter by Agent, or search sessions by meaning — the search uses the configured
optimization LLM to rank candidates by intent, e.g. "fix build error".

![Sessions page with source filters and semantic search](../../../../images/agentsight/en/dashboard-sessions.png)

**Analyze** sends the session to the Optimization page.

## Reuse Labels

Reviews collected trajectories for later Agent reuse. Run deterministic triage first, then confirm or override `good`, `bad`, `useless`, or `unknown` labels individually or in batch. The rules never assign `bad`; that verdict requires a human decision or an LLM judgement with a cited trajectory step.

The optional model judge is available only after enabling `features.reuse_llm_judge` and configuring an optimization LLM. It runs billed requests and reports batch progress while it works. The page is advertised through the always-present `reuse_labels` capability; if `reuse.db` is unavailable, it remains visible and explains that labels cannot be read.

## Token Savings

Compares actual Token consumption against the baseline Tokenless would have consumed, broken down by
optimization type, plus a savings ranking and concrete tips.

![Token Savings page](../../../../images/agentsight/en/dashboard-token-savings.png)

Press **Query** after choosing a range; the page starts empty on purpose. Setup:
[Integrations](integrations.md#tokenless-token-savings).

**Export CSV** downloads the displayed sessions from the last successful query as
`token-savings.csv`, in their displayed order. It includes session IDs, Agent names,
request counts and Token metrics; rates use fractions (for example, `0.4` means 40%).
The export omits tool content and uses UTF-8 with a BOM for spreadsheet compatibility.
Text beginning with a spreadsheet formula prefix is prefixed with an apostrophe.
Export is disabled while querying, after a query error, or when there are no sessions.

To compare a subset, check the box on each session row (or the box in the table header
to select or clear every session) and press **Export Selected (N)**. The download uses
the same columns, escaping, units and file lifecycle as the full export, keeps the
displayed row order, and reads only the already loaded results — it never issues another
request. Checking a box does not expand or collapse the row; the selection is keyed by
session ID, and it is cleared whenever a new successful query replaces the snapshot.
The button stays disabled while querying, after a query error, or while nothing is selected.

## Optimization

Runs LLM-assisted analysis over one session in six dimensions: `perf`, `perf-issues`, `cost`,
`cost-waste`, `accuracy`, and `summary`. Analyses need an LLM configured on the Settings page and
take roughly 10–60 seconds; results are stored, so the page also lists earlier runs.

![Optimization page](../../../../images/agentsight/en/dashboard-optimization.png)

## Skill Metrics

Skill adoption computed on demand from GenAI events: analyzed calls, discovered Skills, load counts,
usage ratio, per-call distribution, and a weekly hotness ranking. The unit of counting is one LLM
call.

![Skill Metrics page](../../../../images/agentsight/en/dashboard-skill-metrics.png)

## Security Observability and System Audit

Present when agent-sec-core is installed. Security Observability shows scan verdicts (prompt
injection, PII, code scanning) per session and run; System Audit aggregates audit events into cases
you can review and, with the enforcer present, contain.

![System Audit page](../../../../images/agentsight/en/dashboard-system-audit.png)

## Trajectory Viewer

Loads any session or conversation as an ATIF v1.7 trajectory: Agent metadata, step and Token totals,
Tokenless comparison, and the full interaction timeline — system preamble, each round, tool calls,
and results. **Download JSON** exports the trajectory; **Import JSON** replays one captured
elsewhere.

![Trajectory Viewer for one session](../../../../images/agentsight/en/dashboard-session-trajectory.png)

This is the page to open when you need to know exactly what the Agent sent and received.

**Filter round content** searches the currently selected trajectory locally. It matches a
case-insensitive literal substring in messages, reasoning, tool names, arguments, and result content,
and shows the matching/total round count. **Clear filter** restores the full list. The selected round
detail stays visible while filtering; selecting another trajectory or importing/loading a new
document clears the filter. Searching sends no model request and leaves **Download JSON** unchanged.

## Settings

The SQLite storage card consumes schema v2 from authenticated `GET /api/storage/status`. On Linux,
it includes every AgentSight-owned store plus the external Tokenless target, including the new reuse
and causal entries. Each card shows the effective retention and size policy, physical and logical usage,
cleanup state, and coverage (`full`, `partial`, or external). Trajectories, security audit, reuse,
causal, and enforcement are partial because maintenance intentionally protects bookkeeping,
active graphs, the newest cache entry, human decisions, or live control state.

The same card now shows `scheduled`, `worker_running`, the worker heartbeat, last attempt, last
successful attempt, `last_result`, consecutive failures, and the next run. These runtime fields describe
only the process serving the endpoint; an unscheduled trace-owned store does not prove that a separate
trace process is stopped. A `lock_busy` result means another process held that database's maintenance lock. Do not infer worker health from
`within_policy`: logical usage can be within the limit while a job is unscheduled, the worker is
stopped, or recent attempts failed. Logical usage excludes reusable freelist pages, so a large
physical file can also be healthy. The API never exposes filesystem paths.

This page also configures the LLM used by optimization and semantic search (provider, base URL,
model, API key, and the semantic-search ranking timeout). A timed-out ranking returns no results and
is recorded as a server warning. The key is masked when read back and stored in
`optimization_config.json` next to the databases.

## Language

The UI follows the browser language and offers a manual switch in the top-right corner; the choice
persists across reloads.

## Query the API instead

Everything on these pages comes from the HTTP API, and the route list is served by the API itself:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:7396/api/docs | python3 -m json.tool | head -30

# remote access needs the token
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://<host>:7396/api/sessions
```

See [Data and storage](data-and-storage.md#http-api) for the endpoint groups.
