# SkillSec V2

[中文版](../../../zh/agent-security/agent-sec-core/skillsec-v2.md)

SkillSec scans Skill content, signs its results, retains recoverable versions and publishes the
selected version to SkillFS. Built-in scanning runs locally without model calls. The Rust CLI keeps
the `agent-sec-cli skill-ledger` entry point and sends operations to one root daemon.

This page covers the V2 core and its Hook adapters. The [Skill Ledger guide](skill-ledger.md)
retains the V1 reference and host-specific matching and policy controls. The adapters retain their
existing languages, defaults and enablement; their CLI calls use the Rust daemon.

## Installation boundary

The normal released-component route is `sudo anolisa --install-mode system install sec-core`, followed by
the Alinux RPM alternative described in [installation](QUICKSTART.md#installation). These routes
select published artifacts; they do not select this unreleased V2 migration branch. Do not assume
that installing a release supplies SkillSec V2.

For a V2 RPM, build this branch with the repository recipe on Linux. The full recipe also builds
the unchanged sandbox and plugin packages and needs Node.js 22.14 or later, Rust 1.93 or later,
RPM tools, systemd RPM macros, a C compiler, pkg-config and OpenSSL development headers:

```sh
./scripts/rpm-build.sh agent-sec-core-v2
sudo yum install ./scripts/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/agent-sec-cli-*.rpm
```

Use the matching architecture directory on aarch64. Install the core CLI package for this phase;
the metapackage also pulls Agent integrations. Use plugin packages from the same revision
as this Hook migration; updating the CLI alone does not update already loaded plugins. V1 and V2 CLI
packages use the same package name and executable paths, so installing V2 replaces V1. Stop V1
writers and retain a matching backup first, as described under deployment rollback below.

For a core-only source installation, use Linux and Rust 1.93 or later. From the repository root:

```sh
make -C src/agent-sec-core build-cli-v2
sudo make -C src/agent-sec-core install-core-v2
```

This produces `src/agent-sec-core/target/v2/bin/agent-sec-cli` and `agent-sec-daemon`.
The core binaries require no Python Ledger runtime. `install-core-v2` installs both binaries into
`/usr/bin`, the system unit into `/usr/lib/systemd/system`, and an initial 0600 configuration into
`/etc/agent-sec/skillsec.json`. Reinstallation preserves an existing configuration; RPM uses
`%config(noreplace)`. Installation does not initialize a signing key or enable Agent Hooks.

RPM follows the distribution's systemd preset and may enable this service at boot. Review its
configuration, then explicitly start the root system service:

```sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now agent-sec-core.service
sudo systemctl status agent-sec-core.service
agent-sec-cli skill-ledger status
```

Use system `systemctl`, without `--user`. The unit creates runtime/state/log directories, keeps
the key and logs private, and grants only `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE`, `CAP_CHOWN` and `CAP_FOWNER` to the
daemon. It retains `NoNewPrivileges`, `SystemCallFilter=@system-service`, native syscall
architecture, `MemoryDenyWriteExecute` and kernel protections, while keeping HOME, `/tmp`, system Skill
directories and shared mounts accessible for scanning, metadata publication and rollback. It does
not grant `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` to the daemon. Custom SkillFS mounts must be visible to the service. In-place SkillFS backing setup requires kernel support for `open_tree` and `move_mount`,
and access to `/proc/self/fd`. Unsupported or denied mount operations fail closed. The daemon
does not need an additional mount capability.

Use an isolated deployment for evaluation: V1 and V2 must never write the same Skill metadata
concurrently. Implementation and actual Linux delivery acceptance are tracked separately in the
[migration document](../../../../../src/agent-sec-core/docs/design/SKILL_SEC_PHASE_ONE.md).

`V2_CARGO_TARGET_DIR` selects a shared Cargo build cache; `V2_BIN_BUILD_DIR` selects the binary
staging directory. Pass the same staging override to build and install. To validate an existing
Linux build's staged installation and preservation of configuration:

```sh
bash src/agent-sec-core/tests/packaging/test-skillsec-install.sh
```

This staging check does not start systemd or establish live installation acceptance.

For a foreground development daemon, first create a root-owned runtime directory with mode 0755
and an empty root-owned state directory with mode 0700. Supply the absolute socket through
`agent-sec-daemon serve --socket /run/agent-sec-core/daemon.sock` and optionally supply
`--skillsec-config /etc/agent-sec/skillsec.json`. The process must run as root. Its runtime
directory must already exist; it creates the private state directory if absent.

## Agent Hook integration

Restart the Agent after installing the matching plugin or changing its trusted launch environment.
Keep `AGENT_SEC_DAEMON_SOCKET` consistent with the daemon when using a non-default socket. Before
loading a Skill, run `agent-sec-cli skill-ledger status` and explicitly scan that Skill to establish
V2 trust; a V1 key or manifest does not establish V2 trust.

| Host | Query | Initialization on a matched Skill call | Default policy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | `check` | Idempotent `init --no-baseline` | `ask`, delivered as a warning at UserPromptSubmit |
| Qoder | `check` | None | `ask` |
| Qwen Code | `show` | Idempotent `init --no-baseline` | `ask` |
| Cosh-NG | `show` | Idempotent `init --no-baseline` | `ask` |
| OpenClaw | `show` | Idempotent `init --no-baseline` | `ask` |
| Hermes | `show` | None | `observe` |

The four initializing adapters ask the daemon on each matched invocation. They do not inspect
HOME key files, scan Skills, reset an unsafe key, or rotate keys. OpenClaw does not initialize at
plugin registration or retain a process-wide readiness result. Disabled and unmatched Hooks do
not invoke the CLI. Qoder and Hermes retain their read-only behavior; initialize trust explicitly
for these hosts. Host approval applies to the current invocation and does not write a Ledger decision.

`check` consumers accept a valid risk result with exit code 1; they do not mistake it for a transport
failure. `show` consumers require exit code 0 and a valid exposure summary, then use `message` to
apply their existing policy. An active `warn` version, or an explicit manual decision, can have a
null message. `hidden` is enforced by SkillFS exposure; the Hook does not independently deny direct
filesystem access based on that field. An unmanaged Skill is outside this managed exposure path.

A missing CLI, unavailable daemon, timeout or invalid response produces a diagnostic. Codex,
Cosh-NG, Qwen Code, OpenClaw and Hermes retain fail-open execution-error behavior; Qoder applies its
configured policy to an error as before. Failure to initialize stops that invocation before
`check`/`show`; it does not fall back to Python. The diagnostic does not copy raw CLI stderr.

Cosh-NG allows 10 seconds for the complete SkillSec Hook: up to 3 seconds for initialization,
5 seconds for `show`, and 2 seconds of startup/processing margin. The `capabilities` environment
view continues to report the 5-second query budget, not the host manifest deadline.

Adapter-to-daemon tests and native Agent acceptance are separate. Current evidence and remaining
host limitations are recorded in the [migration document](../../../../../src/agent-sec-core/docs/design/SKILL_SEC_PHASE_ONE.md#hook-follow-up).

## System configuration and trust

The daemon reads root-owned `/etc/agent-sec/skillsec.json`; `--skillsec-config` selects another
absolute file. Parent directories must be trusted, the file must not be group/world writable,
and symlinks or multiply linked configuration files are rejected. A missing default file uses
the following defaults; a malformed or unsafe file fails startup.

```json
{
  "stateDir": "/var/lib/agent-sec/skillsec",
  "managedSkillDirs": []
}
```

`managedSkillDirs` defines the ordinary-directory authorization boundary. It accepts absolute
paths in the same three forms as V1:

| Entry | Authorized and discovered Skills |
| --- | --- |
| `/srv/skills/demo` | This exact Skill |
| `/srv/skills/*` | Direct, non-hidden Skill children |
| `/srv/skills/**` | Skills at any depth, including `/srv/skills` itself if it has `SKILL.md` |

Wildcards skip hidden descendants and do not follow symlinks. An explicitly named host directory
such as `/home/alice/.hermes/skills/*` is supported. General glob syntax and `~` are not expanded;
use absolute paths in system configuration. An empty list allows no ordinary Skill directories.
Authenticated SkillFS mounts are authorized separately by their existing root-owned mount settings.

As root, edit the existing configuration with `sudoedit /etc/agent-sec/skillsec.json`, preserving
`stateDir`, scanner and SkillFS settings. For example, set:

```json
"managedSkillDirs": ["/srv/skills/*", "/home/alice/.hermes/skills/**"]
```

Apply configuration changes with `sudo systemctl restart agent-sec-core.service`. New Skill
children under an existing wildcard need no configuration update or restart. Ordinary users can
then scan, certify, query and modify any Skill within the approved range; no per-user ACL is added.
Paths outside it return `PermissionDenied`, including `analyze`, and cannot be registered implicitly.

`init`, `scan --all` and `check --all` combine configured-pattern discovery, still-authorized
registered roots, and caller discovery. Caller-supplied roots are checked before Skill I/O; a batch
containing an out-of-range root is rejected before any member is processed. Use an explicit approved
Skill path, or ask root to add the intended parent pattern. Registration stores exact history and
cannot expand configuration. `status` uses configured patterns and authorized history independently
of caller HOME. Removing a pattern does not delete that Skill's existing metadata; startup recovery
also refuses ordinary operations on roots outside the current range.

At daemon startup, ordinary configured Skills and authorized history are scanned in the background,
including Skills without prior registration. The same worker handles registered SkillFS Skills and
notifications; it never discovers mounted Skills by traversing FUSE. The socket opens without waiting
for scanning to finish. Each unchanged, fully scanned Skill remains a no-op.

For `scan --all` and the `init` baseline, an authorized direct child of `/usr/share/anolisa/skills`
or `/usr/local/share/anolisa/skills` is skipped if the daemon itself cannot write its host Ledger
location, including a read-only filesystem. The result is `status: skipped`,
`reasonCode: readonly_system_skill`, `persisted: false`; it does not certify the Skill as safe.
Explicit scans, SkillFS failures, out-of-range paths and other storage failures remain errors.

Default discovery skips hidden child directories, including Ledger snapshots; legitimate Skill
locations beneath host directories such as `.hermes/skills` remain supported.
It includes direct Skill children of `$XDG_DATA_HOME/anolisa/skills`, using the CLI caller's
environment. If `XDG_DATA_HOME` is unset, empty, relative, or contains `.`/`..` path segments, it
uses `$HOME/.local/share/anolisa/skills`, matching ANOLISA's user installation layout. If `HOME`
is unset or empty, it uses the CLI user's system account home directory. A valid
override whose directory is absent is skipped without falling back. Explicit Skill paths and
`init --no-baseline` do not invoke discovery.

The state directory is root-owned 0700; `signing-key.pk8` is 0600. All local users may operate all
managed Skills in phase one. Ownership is not an authorization ACL. Only kernel UID 0 may rotate
the key. The key signs daemon-computed records, not arbitrary caller-provided bytes.

V1 history, encrypted keys and keyrings are not imported. New manifests bind the canonical
absolute Skill identity. Moving a Skill to another identity requires establishing trust there.
Different Skills with the same directory name retain separate identities.

## Core workflow

Run these commands as the ordinary user whose Skill is being managed. `init --no-baseline`
initializes only the shared key. `scan` also initializes a missing key; neither operation silently
replaces a damaged key.

```sh
agent-sec-cli skill-ledger init --no-baseline
agent-sec-cli skill-ledger list-scanners
agent-sec-cli skill-ledger analyze /path/to/skill
agent-sec-cli skill-ledger scan /path/to/skill
agent-sec-cli skill-ledger check /path/to/skill
agent-sec-cli skill-ledger show /path/to/skill
agent-sec-cli skill-ledger audit /path/to/skill --verify-snapshots
agent-sec-cli skill-ledger status --verbose
```

`analyze` requires an authorized Skill path but remains read-only and does not initialize keys or write a Ledger. The default built-ins are
`code-scanner` and `static-scanner`. `scan --scanners code-scanner,static-scanner` selects them
explicitly. Changed content creates a version; unchanged content fills missing scan results.
`scan --force` replaces scan results for unchanged content without inventing a content version.

The six integrity states are:

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `none` | Content has no authenticated scan verdict yet |
| `pass` | Authenticated content has a passing scan result |
| `warn` | Authenticated content has warning findings |
| `deny` | Authenticated content has denying findings |
| `drifted` | Current content differs from the authenticated record |
| `tampered` | Ledger metadata, signature or version binding fails authentication |

Execution errors and `unmanaged` diagnostics are not additional integrity states. A successful
scan means the scan completed, not that its security verdict is `pass`.

Before the first key initialization, checking a Skill with no Ledger returns `none` and exit 0;
auditing its empty history also succeeds. Neither query creates keys or metadata. Existing Ledger
artifacts with missing or invalid keys do not qualify as an empty history.

## External findings, decisions and recovery

Import an external JSON findings report through the CLI. Custom `skill`, `cli` or `api` scanner
entries are import-only; the root daemon never executes their configured commands.

```sh
agent-sec-cli skill-ledger certify /path/to/skill --findings /path/to/findings.json --scanner skill-vetter
agent-sec-cli skill-ledger decide /path/to/skill --action allow --reason 'Reviewed this version'
agent-sec-cli skill-ledger decide /path/to/skill --action always_allow
agent-sec-cli skill-ledger decide /path/to/skill --action block
agent-sec-cli skill-ledger decide /path/to/skill --action rollback --version v000001
agent-sec-cli skill-ledger decide /path/to/skill --clear
agent-sec-cli skill-ledger export /path/to/skill --version v000001 --output /path/to/empty-export
agent-sec-cli skill-ledger activate /path/to/skill
```

`allow` approves the selected version; `always_allow` persists the broader manual approval.
`block` hides exposure. `rollback` restores the selected authenticated snapshot and records the
decision; `--clear` removes the manual decision. Rollback restores files to the Skill directory
owner so that its user can edit them afterward; privileged file mode bits are stripped.

Export writes `snapshot/`, `manifest.json` and `findings.json` to an empty caller-owned directory.
The CLI creates missing export directories as the caller with mode 0700 and leaves existing
directory permissions unchanged. It refuses a nonempty
destination. `--delete-findings` deletes the imported local report only after successful
certification and confirmation that the report has not changed. It reports
`findingsDeleted: true` on deletion. Failed cleanup returns `findingsDeleted: false` and
`findingsDeleteError` while preserving the committed certification and its success exit code.
Deletion uses the CLI caller's permissions. Failed or malformed daemon responses never delete input.

`show` exposes `active`, `pending` or `hidden` selection. With `pass_warn_only`, an eligible
authenticated `pass` or `warn` version may be exposed automatically; unsafe latest content may
retain an eligible previous version or a pending view. Manual decisions affect that selection.
`activation.activationPending=true` means Ledger work committed but publication did not complete.
Inspect `show` and retry `activate` after repairing the reported cause. Daemon restart reconciles
supported interrupted publication and rollback states. No durable notification queue is promised.

Startup recovery covers registered Skills. If the first scan reports a registration failure after
writing its version, resolve that failure and retry `scan` for the same Skill. Unchanged content
reuses the verified version and completes registration before activation; a failed first request
is not guaranteed to be discovered automatically after restart.

## SkillFS binding

SkillFS uses the same public socket as ordinary CLI calls. Its notify handshake and messages retain
their existing HMAC contract; ordinary V2 JSON remains strict. The public socket must be root-owned
0666 under a root-owned 0755 directory. SkillFS also checks ancestor safety and the actual kernel
peer UID. The permission change does not permit plaintext fallback or bypass HMAC.

Configure explicit canonical/backing mappings in the daemon:

```json
{
  "stateDir": "/var/lib/agent-sec/skillsec",
  "managedSkillDirs": ["/home/alice/.openclaw/skills/demo"],
  "skillfs": {
    "authKeyFile": "/etc/agent-sec/skillfs-hmac.key",
    "mounts": [{
      "controlSocket": "/run/user/1000/skillfs/control.sock",
      "canonicalRoot": "/home/alice/.openclaw/skills",
      "liveRoot": "/home/alice/.openclaw/live-skills",
      "peerUid": 1000
    }]
  }
}
```

Use a separate random HMAC secret, 32–4096 bytes, never the signing key. The daemon's copy must be
root-owned 0600. Provision the same bytes in a separate 0600 file owned by the SkillFS user; do not
make the daemon's private file world-readable. For this UID-1000 example, set SkillFS notify
`socket_path` to `/run/agent-sec-core/daemon.sock` and its `auth_key_file` to that private user copy.
Its control socket remains UID-1000 owned, parent 0700/socket 0600; set control
`trusted_peer_uid=0` and `trusted_peer_key_file` to the same private copy. Use HMAC authentication;
leave `trusted_peer_exe` unset because executable authentication is a separate, mutually exclusive
mode. Configure SkillFS activation
and its backing root following the [SkillFS runtime reference](../../../../../src/skillfs/docs/security/runtime-activation-implementation-plan.md),
using the V2 daemon endpoint and peer identity above instead of that document's older examples.

Both processes must see the configured absolute paths and the same backing filesystem objects.
A container deployment therefore needs matching shared-volume paths. Canonical and live roots
may be identical for one ordinary non-in-place mount; otherwise they must be disjoint and
must not overlap other configured mappings. Resolver failure does not fall back to scanning the
FUSE view. A mismatched directory inode is rejected instead of certifying replacement content.

Notifications coalesce per Skill, then trigger scan followed by activation. A notify acknowledgment
confirms queue admission only. `status` includes `skillfs` queue/running/processed/failed counters
when configured. Check those counters, public audit and actual FUSE reads to distinguish admission,
completed processing and visible publication. Startup reschedules registered mount Skills.

## Output, audit and limits

The CLI prints business JSON to stdout. `check` returns 1 for `deny`, `tampered` or execution error;
completed scan/certify and complete analyze return 0 even for risk findings. Incomplete analyze
returns 1; invalid analyze input returns 2. Transport failures go to stderr and return 1. Always
inspect verdict and activation fields as well as the process exit code.

Use `--socket` or `AGENT_SEC_DAEMON_SOCKET` for an explicit endpoint. SkillSec defaults to 60
seconds; `--timeout-ms` is capped at 120 seconds server-side. A timeout does not establish whether
a write committed. Read status/history before retrying a mutation. Oversized responses return
`ResponseTooLarge` and `operationMayHaveCommitted=true`, rather than truncated data.

Public audit uses the shared Action Runtime and the private `/var/log/agent-sec` event store.
Its projection contains operation, counts, verdict, version and error class; it omits source code,
raw findings, local paths, manual reasons and keys. Full business data remains in the CLI response.
Built-in scans are bounded to 2,000 files, 50 MiB and depth 32; findings import is limited to 2 MiB.
Coverage failures remain visible instead of certifying partial content.

## Key rotation and deployment rollback

```sh
sudo agent-sec-cli skill-ledger rotate-keys
agent-sec-cli skill-ledger scan --all
```

Rotation withdraws registered exposure before replacing the key. Earlier signatures then lose
trust, including earlier V2 signatures. Rescan and activate to rebuild trust; no previous-key
verification fallback exists. If withdrawal fails, the old key remains and ordinary Ledger writes
are fenced until root retries or startup recovery completes.

Before changing an existing deployment, stop its daemon and SkillFS writers, retain its matching
binary/configuration, and back up private key/state plus each Skill's content and `.skill-meta`.
Use copies for migration evaluation. To return to V1, stop V2 and restore the matching V1 files,
keys, configuration and metadata before starting V1/SkillFS. Do not point V1 at V2 manifests or
mix restored old metadata with modified source content. Keeping a binary alone is not a state
rollback, and starting both daemons is not an upgrade strategy.
