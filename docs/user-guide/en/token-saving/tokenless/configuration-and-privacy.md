# Tokenless Configuration and Data Privacy

[中文版](../../../zh/token-saving/tokenless/configuration-and-privacy.md)

Tokenless enables compression, local statistics, and SLS metrics by default. Because local statistics and Stash may contain complete tool output or truncated original payloads, review these defaults before processing source code, credentials, or production logs.

## Configuration precedence

In the normal path, each toggle uses:

```text
Environment variable > ~/.tokenless/config.json > default
```

An empty environment variable is treated as unset. For Boolean environment variables, `1`, `true`, and `yes` are true, case-insensitively; any other non-empty value is false. Prefer explicit `true` or `false` values for readability.

There is one current implementation exception: when both `TOKENLESS_STATS_ENABLED` and `TOKENLESS_SLS_ENABLED` are non-empty, the config file is skipped completely. In that branch, compression uses `TOKENLESS_COMPRESSION_ENABLED` when set and otherwise defaults to `true`. If you export both recording variables, export the compression variable explicitly as well.

## Configuration file

Configuration path:

```text
~/.tokenless/config.json
```

Complete example:

```json
{
  "stats_enabled": true,
  "sls_enabled": true,
  "compression_enabled": true
}
```

A missing, unreadable, or invalid JSON file is silently replaced by the all-`true` defaults in memory. Validate a manually edited file with:

```bash
jq . ~/.tokenless/config.json
```

| Field | Default | Actual behavior |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| `stats_enabled` | `true` | Writes complete before/after text and metrics to local SQLite |
| `sls_enabled` | `true` | Appends a metrics-only record when the target JSONL file exists |
| `compression_enabled` | `true` | Returns compressed output when true; false runs dry-run and returns the original |

When Tokenless writes the configuration, it restricts the mode to `0600`. Confirm the mode after creating it manually:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.tokenless/config.json
```

The `stats` subcommands change only `stats_enabled`:

```bash
tokenless stats status
tokenless stats enable
tokenless stats disable
```

An environment override still wins after these commands. For example, `TOKENLESS_STATS_ENABLED=0 tokenless stats enable` saves `true` to the file, but recording remains disabled for processes that keep the environment override.

## Optional Git Diff context cropping

Git Diff cropping is disabled by default. Set `TOKENLESS_DIFF_COMPRESSION_ENABLED=1`
in the environment inherited by Tokenless or its host agent to enable it; unset the
variable or set it to `0` to disable it. `1`, `true`, and `yes` enable it
(case-insensitively). This option is independent of the general compression switch
and is not a `config.json` field. With cropping enabled,
`TOKENLESS_COMPRESSION_ENABLED=0` measures candidates but returns the original.

Rust callers use `RuntimeConfig.diff_compression_enabled`; Python callers use
`TokenlessConfig(diff_compression_enabled=True)` or the native `TokenlessRuntime`
keyword of the same name. SDK options default to false and are explicit; this CLI
environment variable does not override them.

The compressor handles complete ordinary Git diffs received as successful command
output. It requires a text replacement slot, an available Stash, and a supported
recovery method. All additions, deletions, metadata, and up to two available context
lines around changes are retained. Within each hunk, it may retain extra context
when splitting would add more header overhead. It only adopts output when both
characters decrease and the heuristic token estimate saves at least 16 tokens,
including the notice and recovery instruction. This estimate uses no runtime
tokenizer and does not guarantee a reduction for every model tokenizer.

The emitted operation is `diff_reduction` and recoverability is `retrievable`, not
`lossless`: unmodified context is omitted from the visible output. Follow the
emitted shell or tool instruction to retrieve the received original while it is in
Stash. Recovery requires an additional tool call. File reads and results already
marked as RTK-optimized bypass this compressor; enabling it does not change RTK
command rewriting. Unsupported or incomplete diffs pass through. Special file
sections such as renames and binary summaries retain their received bytes; encoded
binary patches pass through in full. Tokenless does not open host-persisted output
files to complete truncated diffs or change the host's truncation limit.

Local compression and original recovery have been verified on finite samples.
Stable whole-Agent token savings have not been established, so this feature remains
opt-in.

## HTML page rendering

HTML page rendering is enabled by default. Set `TOKENLESS_HTML_EXTRACTION_ENABLED=0`
in the environment inherited by Tokenless or its host agent to disable it. When unset
or empty it stays enabled; `1`, `true`, and `yes` also enable it (case-insensitively),
and any other value disables it. This option is independent of the general compression
switch and is not a `config.json` field. With rendering enabled,
`TOKENLESS_COMPRESSION_ENABLED=0` measures candidates but returns the original.

The SDKs and native bindings do not read this environment variable. To turn rendering
off there, Rust callers set `RuntimeConfig.html_extraction_enabled` to `false`, and
Python callers pass `TokenlessConfig(html_extraction_enabled=False)` or the native
`TokenlessRuntime` keyword of the same name.

The compressor handles complete HTML documents (starting with `<!doctype html` or
`<html>`) received as successful command output or API responses, for example a page
fetched with `curl` or returned by an MCP tool. It requires a text replacement slot,
an available Stash, and a supported recovery method. Text after the closing `</html>`
tag, such as a status code or the output of a following command, is kept after the
view. The page is rendered as a Markdown subset: headings, paragraphs, lists, tables,
fenced code with its language, links with targets, image alt text, quotes, and
admonitions. MathML formulas render as their TeX annotation or `alttext` between `$`
signs; cells spanning rows or columns leave empty cells in the slots they cover, and
rows are not padded to the widest row; paragraph lines that start like a Markdown
heading, list item, quote, rule or code fence are escaped. The content root is
`<main>`, an element with `role=main`, or the only outermost `<article>` (articles
nested inside it, such as comments, do not count); otherwise the whole body.
Scripts, styles, `noscript`, templates, SVG, iframes, comments, `nav`, `aside`,
page-level `header`/`footer`, elements with navigation, banner, contentinfo, or
complementary roles, form controls (`button`, `input`, `select`, `textarea`,
`datalist`, `progress`, `meter`), media embeds (`audio`, `video`, `canvas`, `object`,
`embed`, `map`), and `dialog` are removed; `menu` renders as a list, and `label`,
`legend`, and `fieldset` stay because content tabs keep their titles there. The first line of the view names
the root, the number of nodes omitted outside it, and every removal count by
category. Pages whose
rendered body is shorter than 64 characters, such as application shells, pass through,
and so do pages whose markup nests deeper than 512 elements: HTML parsing time grows
quadratically with nesting depth, so such pages are not parsed at all.
It only adopts output when both characters decrease and the heuristic token estimate
saves at least 16 tokens, including the notice and recovery instruction.

The emitted operation is `html_extraction` and recoverability is `retrievable`, not
`lossless`: markup and the removed elements are not in the visible output. Follow the
emitted shell or tool instruction to retrieve the received original while it is in
Stash. Content that a page loads through scripts is not visible in the view. Content
origin is classified by the adapters: file read tool results pass through, and shell
tool results carry the command line, from which Core reports commands that only print
local files (`cat`, `head`, `tail`, `nl`, `less`, `more`, `bat`, and `sed -n` with a
print-only script, optionally after `cd … &&`) as `file_read`. JSON, CSV, build logs
and diffs in such output still compress, but a printed HTML page is source the agent
may edit and stays verbatim. A read combined with a pipe, redirection or another
command, and a page returned by an MCP file tool, is still rendered like a fetched page
and must be retrieved to see its source.

Local rendering and original recovery have been verified on finite samples.

## Environment variables

### Common user variables

| Variable | Purpose | Constraint |
|----------|---------|------------|
| `TOKENLESS_STATS_ENABLED` | Override local statistics | Does not affect SLS or Stash |
| `TOKENLESS_SLS_ENABLED` | Override SLS metrics | Does not affect local statistics |
| `TOKENLESS_COMPRESSION_ENABLED` | Override active compression | False is dry-run, not a full stop |
| `TOKENLESS_DATA_DIR` | Directory containing `stats.db` and `stash.db` | Any accessible absolute directory except filesystem root; no parent traversal |
| `TOKENLESS_STATS_DB` | Override the statistics database | Must be under the real user home or selected data directory |
| `TOKENLESS_STASH_DB` | Override the Stash database | Must be under the real user home or selected data directory |
| `TOKENLESS_SLS_PATH` | Override the SLS JSONL path | Must be under `/var/log/` or `/tmp/` |
| `TOKENLESS_DIFF_COMPRESSION_ENABLED` | Enable Git Diff context cropping | Off by default; `1`, `true`, or `yes` enables; does not override SDK options |
| `TOKENLESS_HTML_EXTRACTION_ENABLED` | Switch HTML page rendering | On by default; `1`, `true`, or `yes` enables, any other non-empty value disables; does not override SDK options |

### Adapter and diagnostic variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `TOKENLESS_AGENT_ID` | Agent identifier injected by an adapter |
| `TOKENLESS_SESSION_ID` | Session identifier injected by an adapter |
| `TOKENLESS_TOOL_USE_ID` | Tool-call identifier injected by an adapter |
| `TOKENLESS_TRACEPARENT` | W3C trace context override stamped onto SLS records |
| `TRACEPARENT` | Standard W3C trace context variable, injected by the launching host or adapter |
| `TOKENLESS_TOOL_READY_SPEC` | Override the Tool Ready dependency specification |
| `TOKENLESS_ENV_FIX_SCRIPT` | Override the environment repair script |
| `TOKENLESS_PACKAGE_MANAGER` | Override package-manager detection, mainly for tests |

Tool Ready is hard-disabled in this build. Its specification and repair-script overrides are retained for the dormant legacy implementation but have no runtime effect. They are subject to trusted-path validation and are not recommended for normal users.

`TOKENLESS_TRACEPARENT` and the standard `TRACEPARENT` carry a W3C trace context for SLS records. Injecting one is the launcher's job: OpenTelemetry propagates W3C context through in-process carriers and does not export the active span as a process variable, so a host or adapter that wants correlation has to set one of these two variables in the environment it spawns Tokenless with. Tokenless only reads them. The override is read first, and an empty or unparsable override falls back to the standard variable so one typo cannot drop correlation for a whole session. Both are optional: when neither carries a usable context, records keep the previous shape and are written uncorrelated. The identity is stamped only onto the SLS JSONL — the local statistics database does not store it.

Database path priority is:

- Stats: `TOKENLESS_STATS_DB` > `TOKENLESS_DATA_DIR/stats.db` > `~/.tokenless/stats.db`
- Stash: `--stash-db` > `TOKENLESS_STASH_DB` > `TOKENLESS_DATA_DIR/stash.db` > `~/.tokenless/stash.db`

`TOKENLESS_DATA_DIR` is an explicit directory-level relocation and may point outside the real user home, including to a managed service directory under `/var/lib`. Both the CLI and bundled RTK writer reject filesystem root, relative paths, parent traversal, and existing non-directory targets. Without a valid higher-priority file override, an invalid explicit data directory disables that operation's SQLite state instead of silently falling back to home.

An empty value is treated as unset. `TOKENLESS_DATA_DIR` may name a directory that does not exist yet; Tokenless canonicalizes its nearest existing ancestor before creating it. File-level overrides are accepted only beneath the canonical real home or selected data directory, and existing database symlinks are rejected. `TOKENLESS_DATA_DIR` does not relocate `~/.tokenless/config.json` or the SLS JSONL output.

DeepSeek Harness is an exception to the default database location because its
sandbox removes inherited `TOKENLESS_*` variables and may not expose the home
directory. Its adapter uses `.tokenless` in the session workspace unless
`TOKENLESS_DATA_DIR` is set, and publishes managed shell aliases for that
directory plus `TOKENLESS_STATS_DB` and `TOKENLESS_STASH_DB`. The default
workspace directory contains a `.gitignore` with `*`, so complete tool text,
Stash payloads, and SQLite sidecars are not staged by `git add -A`. Custom paths
are not modified; make them accessible to the DSH shell sandbox and exclude
them from source control or backups as required by your data policy.

## Local and external data

| Data | Default path | Default content | Retention | Stop new data |
|------|--------------|-----------------|-----------|---------------|
| Local statistics | `~/.tokenless/stats.db` | Complete before/after text, identifiers, and metrics | No automatic TTL; retained until cleared | `tokenless stats disable` |
| Stash | `~/.tokenless/stash.db` | Original strings, dropped middle segments of truncated arrays, complete object record arrays reduced to a sampled subset, deep subtrees, schema descriptions removed by truncation, build/log gaps, and the complete original of rendered HTML pages | One-hour TTL and 10,000 live entries; expired rows are purged lazily | CLI: `--no-stash`; agent: disable the adapter |
| Configuration | `~/.tokenless/config.json` | Three Boolean toggles | Persistent | Not applicable |
| SLS JSONL | `/var/log/anolisa/sls/ops/tokenless.jsonl` | Metrics and identifiers, no compressed source text | Managed by SLS/Logtail infrastructure | `TOKENLESS_SLS_ENABLED=0` or config false |

### Sensitivity of local statistics

`before_text` and `after_text` in `stats.db` preserve complete content. `tokenless stats show` prints that content, while record-level and tool-use-level `tokenless stats diff` commands can render changed lines from it. They may contain:

- Source code and patches.
- Paths, user names, or environment details from command output.
- Business data returned by an API.
- Access tokens, cookies, or credentials found in logs.

The `tokenless` CLI's SQLite recorder attempts to set `stats.db` to `0600` whenever it opens the database. The bundled RTK statistics patch can create or open the same file directly and does not apply that permission change itself. Do not rely on the process umask; verify the deployed database and sidecars:

```bash
ls -l ~/.tokenless/stats.db*
```

### Sensitivity of Stash

Stash saves the original content removed by truncation, not a summary. For record reduction, the stashed entry is the complete original array before reduction, not only the omitted records. It does not save fields removed solely because they are blacklisted, `null`, or empty. The `tokenless` CLI restricts its path to the real user home or selected data directory, but also verify that the database and SQLite sidecar files are not readable by other local users:

```bash
ls -l ~/.tokenless/stash.db*
```

TTL means that `retrieve` no longer returns an entry after one hour. Expired rows are deleted lazily during a later successful stash write or retrieval, so compression-only workloads also reclaim old entries. TTL is not an immediate secure-erasure guarantee for disk data, and deleting rows does not immediately shrink the SQLite file. When more than 10,000 live entries exist, the store evicts entries with the earliest expiry first, so retrieval can fail before one hour under heavy use.

### SLS excludes original text

Tokenless SLS JSONL includes the component, operation, session/tool-use identifiers, the host trace identity when one was propagated, and character/token metrics. It does not include `before_text` or `after_text`. Identifiers can still be organizational runtime metadata and should follow the platform's log policy.

## Guidance for sensitive workloads

### Compress without recording

```bash
TOKENLESS_STATS_ENABLED=0 \
TOKENLESS_SLS_ENABLED=0 \
  tokenless compress-response --no-stash -f response.json
```

This applies to standalone CLI use. Agent adapters may use Stash by default. If the framework does not provide an appropriate exclusion rule, disable the adapter for sensitive tasks.

### Keep the adapter but do not apply compression

Set this in the environment used to start the agent:

```bash
export TOKENLESS_COMPRESSION_ENABLED=0
```

This is a dry-run and may still write local statistics or SLS. To avoid persistence, also set:

```bash
export TOKENLESS_STATS_ENABLED=0
export TOKENLESS_SLS_ENABLED=0
```

Dry-run does not create Stash entries, but it also does not disable RTK rewriting. Tool Ready is independently hard-disabled. Disable the adapter when all hook behavior must stop.

### Stop Tokenless completely in an agent

```bash
anolisa adapter disable tokenless <framework>
```

Restart the agent afterwards. Setting only `compression_enabled=false` does not stop hook or plugin execution.

## Clear data

Clear local statistics records:

```bash
tokenless stats clear --yes
```

This clears records from the statistics database resolved in the current environment, but it does not remove the database file or SQLite sidecars. Tokenless currently has no Stash clear subcommand. For irreversible local-database removal:

1. Disable every Tokenless adapter.
2. Exit agents and Tokenless processes that may still use the databases.
3. Confirm that statistics history and Stash retrieval are no longer needed.
4. Back up anything that must be retained.
5. Inspect path overrides in the actual environment used to start the agent, service, and Tokenless:

```bash
env | grep -E '^TOKENLESS_(DATA_DIR|STATS_DB|STASH_DB)='
```

The statistics path resolves in this order: `TOKENLESS_STATS_DB`, `TOKENLESS_DATA_DIR/stats.db`, then `~/.tokenless/stats.db`. The Stash path resolves in this order: command-line `--stash-db`, `TOKENLESS_STASH_DB`, `TOKENLESS_DATA_DIR/stash.db`, then `~/.tokenless/stash.db`. Write the final values as verified absolute paths; do not expand untrusted environment values directly into a removal command.

The following command works for default and custom paths. Replace and print both paths first, then confirm that they are the Tokenless databases to remove:

```bash
stats_db='/absolute/path/to/resolved/stats.db'
stash_db='/absolute/path/to/resolved/stash.db'
printf '%s\n' "$stats_db" "$stash_db"
rm -f -- \
  "$stats_db" \
  "$stats_db-wal" \
  "$stats_db-shm" \
  "$stats_db-journal" \
  "$stash_db" \
  "$stash_db-wal" \
  "$stash_db-shm" \
  "$stash_db-journal"
```

This cannot be undone. Do not recursively remove the data directory or `~/.tokenless/` because either location may contain configuration or other files that you want to keep.

## Fine-grained OpenClaw control

The OpenClaw plugin also provides framework-level options:

| Option | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `rtk_enabled` | Rewrite supported shell commands through RTK |
| `tool_ready_enabled` | OpenClaw-side Tool Ready registration gate |
| `post_tool_enabled` | Optimize supported persisted tool results |
| `verbose` | Plugin diagnostic logging |

The OpenClaw plugin does not compress tool schemas or provide content retrieval. Results that cannot
be safely optimized without retrieval pass through unchanged.

RTK, the OpenClaw-side Tool Ready registration gate, and PostTool default to on; verbose logging
defaults to off. The Tool Ready option currently has no operational effect because Tokenless
hard-disables the underlying check. Tokenless automatically decides whether JSON cleanup or TOON is
useful and which tool outputs must pass through unchanged. The removed
`response_compression_enabled`, `toon_compression_enabled`, `skip_tools`, and `shell_tools` keys no
longer control the adapter.

These values are managed by OpenClaw plugin configuration, not `~/.tokenless/config.json`. The
adapter requires OpenClaw Plugin API 2026.4.22 or later. Restart the gateway as instructed after
changing them.
